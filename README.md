# PCB-Ornament
Custom designed PCB ornament using the Attiny85

# Improvements/Things I Learned For Next Time.
* Add pin header for power and ground to remove need to solder them when programming. 
* Can use a serial in parallel out shift register to free up pins on the Attiny85 and also use a matrix to drive more LEDs
* Look into more power saving options, for example: disable ADC and reduce clock frequency
